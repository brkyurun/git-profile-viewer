<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a simple project I did for sharpening my vanilla JavaScript skills as I mostly work with React and Nextjs these days. It's a very simple app that lets you get the profile information of a GitHub user, with links to the relevant sections.

### Built With

The project in itself is fairly simple and minimalistic. It is built with a modern stack, including:

- TailwindCSS
- Vite
- TypeScript
- [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

And that's pretty much it!
